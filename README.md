# Chess Game

This is a simple chess game developed using C++ and Qt. GUI is done through Qt. It showcases available moves and captures for the selected piece, and clearly indicates whose turn it is to move.

## Cool things

- **Highlight Available Moves**: When a piece is selected, the game highlights all the legal directional moves that the piece can make on the board.
- **Highlight Captures**: The game also highlights potential capture moves in red, allowing you to easily identify opportunities to capture their opponent's pieces.
- **Turn Indicator**: The game displays whose turn it is to move

## To-Do List

- [ ] Implement checking functionality to prevent illegal moves that expose the king to check.
- [ ] Implement en passant capture rules for pawns.
- [ ] Implement castling moves for kings and rooks.
- [ ] Deselect piece when initially click on one piece but when clicking on the board to move, click on another piece (currently you have to unselect the piece manually)
